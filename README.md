- The letter **‘D’** represented as 

The dash signal is represented with blinky for 5 sec, the second dot represented with blinky for 2 sec and the third dot is blinky for 2 sec to represent the signal in morse code for letter “D”. The delay of 1 sec is to separate the dash and dot signal.
- The letter **‘T’** represented as

The dash signal is represented with blinky for 5 sec that represent the signal in morse code for letter “T”. The delay of 1 sec is to separate the next letter.
- The letter **‘N’** represented as

The dash signal is represented with blinky for 5 sec and the following dot blinky for 2 sec to represent the signal in morse code for letter “N”. The delay of 1 sec is to separate the dash and dot signal. 

The code snippet shows the morse code for each letter.
